# Terminal-Kelley-Blue-Book

A program that allows you to run a server-side and client-side. The server-side will await incoming connections. Upon connection from the client-side, the client-side will be able to send a .properties file to be processed server-side. The server-side will then receive the file, interpret it, and then store the data accordingly. The client-side will have the options to either upload .properties files (representing cars), or view the data of current cars which the server-side will serve.
